# Equity Portfolio Tracker and Allocation Optimizer
This is one of my first complete python projects. The motivation behind the project was to use historical prices to help me better allocate funds across holdings. I intend to build out other projects that help suggest equities that would improve a portfolio using a variety of techniques, including simple Value Investing, momentum, and knn credit worthiness. This project and readme is under development.
